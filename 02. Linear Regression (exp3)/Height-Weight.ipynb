For example, you might want to see how a person's height affects their weight.\n","\n","Linear Regression helps you create a straight line (or linear equation) that best fits the data points you have. This line can then be used to make predictions.\n","\n","**Components**\n","**Variables:**\n","\n","Independent Variable (Feature): The variable you use to predict another variable. For example, height.\n","Dependent Variable (Target): The variable you want to predict. For example, weight.\n","\n","**Line Equation:**\n","\n","The line is described by the equation:\n","**Weight=Slope×Height+Intercept**\n","\n","Weight=Slope×Height+Intercept.\n","\n","Slope shows how much the weight changes with each unit change in height.\n","\n","Intercept is where the line crosses the y-axis when the height is zero.\n","\n","**Purpose**\n","\n","**Prediction:** Use the line to estimate the weight for a given height.\n","\n","**Relationship:** Understand how changes in height are related to changes in weight.\n","\n","**Visual Representation**\n","\n","**Scatter Plot:** Data points plotted on a graph.\n","\n","**Best-Fit Line: **A straight line drawn through the data points to show the trend.\n","\n","**Example**\n","\n","If you have data showing that taller people generally weigh more, linear regression can help you draw a line that best represents this trend. You can then use this line to predict the weight of someone based on their height.\n","\n","**Summary**\n","\n","Linear regression is like finding the best straight-line path through a scatter of points to understand and predict how one variable affects another."],"metadata":{"id":"cQUFWvpnLwwY"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AuRNrX6eKe_v","outputId":"58d56cf6-7ec1-44e2-e4d1-172ffc8bcf83"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Model Coefficients: [1.]\n","Model Intercept: -100.0\n","Mean Squared Error: 0.0\n","R-squared: nan\n","Predicted weight for height 175 cm is 75.00 kg\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/sklearn/metrics/_regression.py:996: UndefinedMetricWarning: R^2 score is not well-defined with less than two samples.\n","  warnings.warn(msg, UndefinedMetricWarning)\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/sklearn/base.py:465: UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, but LinearRegression was fitted with feature names\n","  warnings.warn(\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score\n","\n","# Sample data\n","data = {\n","    'Height': [150, 160, 170, 180, 190],\n","    'Weight': [50, 60, 70, 80, 90]\n","}\n","\n","# Create a DataFrame\n","df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n","\n","# Features and target variable\n","X = df[['Height']]  # Feature matrix (Height)\n","y = df['Weight']    # Target variable (Weight)\n","\n","# Split the data into training and testing sets\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\n","\n","# Initialize and train the model\n","model = LinearRegression()\n","model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","# Make predictions\n","y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n","\n","# Evaluate the model\n","mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)\n","r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)\n","\n","print(\"Model Coefficients:\", model.coef_)\n","print(\"Model Intercept:\", model.intercept_)\n","print(\"Mean Squared Error:\", mse)\n","print(\"R-squared:\", r2)\n","\n","# Predict weight for a new height\n","new_height = np.array([[175]])\n","predicted_weight = model.predict(new_height)\n","print(f\"Predicted weight for height {new_height[0][0]} cm is {predicted_weight[0]:.2f} kg\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Explanation**\n","\n","**Data Preparation:**\n","\n","We create a sample dataset with Height and Weight.\n","Convert the data into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.\n","\n","**Feature and Target:**\n","\n","X contains the height values (features).\n","y contains the weight values (target).\n","\n","**Train-Test Split:**\n","\n","Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.\n","\n","**Model Training:**\n","\n","Initialize and train a LinearRegression model.\n","\n","**Evaluation:**\n","\n","Compute Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) to assess the model's performance.\n","\n","**Prediction:**\n","\n","Use the trained model to predict weight for a new height.\n","Feel free to adjust the sample data or use your dataset.
